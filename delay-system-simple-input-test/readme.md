# Simulation Program for the Deep Learning Delay System with Simple Input Layer

The following adaptations have to be done before compiling the code:

1. If you want to use a different activation function than f = sin and/or a different input preprocessing function than g = tanh, you need to modify the corresponding functions in f.h.

2. If you want to use a task other than MNIST or Fashion-MNIST, you need to uncomment the corresponding lines in the file global_constants.h.

The program can be excecuted with the following option:
