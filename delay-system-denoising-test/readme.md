# Simulation Program for the Deep Learning Delay System (Fashion-MNIST denoising, validation on test set)

The following adaptations have to be done before compiling the code:

1. If you want to use a different activation function than f = sin and/or a different input preprocessing function than g = tanh, you need to modify the corresponding functions in f.h.

The program can be excecuted with the following option:
